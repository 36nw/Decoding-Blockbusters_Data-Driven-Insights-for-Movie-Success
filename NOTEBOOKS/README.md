# Notebooks Directory - Decoding Blockbusters Project

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks detailing the various stages of analysis and model development for the "Decoding Blockbusters" project. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of the movie dataset, providing insights into movie trends, profitability, and audience reception.

## Notebook Descriptions

1.  **Movies Data Cleaning & EDA:**
    * This notebook focuses on the initial steps of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    * It covers handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and performing basic data exploration to understand the dataset's structure.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Movie Ratings and Revenue:**
    * This notebook explores the relationships between movie ratings (IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes) and revenue (US and Worldwide Gross).
    * It includes visualizations and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and correlations.

3.  **Sentiment Analysis on Movie Titles or Descriptions:**
    * This notebook performs sentiment analysis on movie titles or descriptions to understand the emotional tone associated with movies.
    * It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment scores.

4.  **Movie Budget vs. Revenue Analysis:**
    * This notebook examines the relationship between movie budgets and revenue.
    * It explores how budget influences financial performance and identifies potential trends.

5.  **MPAA Rating vs. Performance Analysis:**
    * This notebook analyzes the impact of MPAA ratings on movie performance.
    * It investigates whether certain ratings correlate with higher or lower revenue.

6.  **Exploration of Movie Distribution Channels:**
    * This notebook explores the different movie distribution channels and their impact on movie success.
    * It examines how distribution strategies influence audience reach and profitability.

7.  **Time Series Analysis of Movie Trends:**
    * This notebook performs time series analysis on movie trends, examining how movie characteristics and performance have evolved over time.
    * It identifies patterns and trends in movie releases and revenue.

8.  **Movie Profitability Analysis:**
    * This notebook focuses on analyzing movie profitability, calculating profit margins, and identifying factors that influence profitability.
    * It explores the financial aspects of movie production and distribution.

9.  **Predictive Model for Movie Success:**
    * This notebook develops predictive models to forecast movie success, using features like budget, ratings, and genre.
    * It evaluates the model's performance and identifies key predictors.

10. **Clustering Movies Based on Features:**
    * This notebook applies clustering techniques (K-Means, hierarchical clustering) to group movies based on their features.
    * It explores how movies can be categorized into distinct groups.

11. **Recommendation System for Movies:**
    * This notebook builds recommendation systems (content-based, collaborative, cluster-based) to personalize movie suggestions.
    * It evaluates the performance of different recommendation approaches.

## Usage
